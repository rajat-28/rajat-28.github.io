# Practical 1: To study design aspects of development enviornment like android, iOS.

#### Android Development Environment

#### 1. Programming Languages
- **Java**: The primary language for Android development for many years.
- **Kotlin**: Officially supported by Google and preferred for new Android applications due to its modern features and interoperability with Java.

#### 2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- **Android Studio**: The official IDE for Android development, based on IntelliJ IDEA. It includes features like code completion, debugging, and a powerful layout editor.

#### 3. Software Development Kit (SDK)
- **Android SDK**: Provides the tools necessary to build, test, and debug Android applications. Includes the Android emulator, platform tools, and various libraries.

#### 4. Build System
- **Gradle**: The build automation tool used in Android Studio to compile, package, and manage dependencies for Android projects.

#### 5. Emulator
- **Android Emulator**: Part of the Android SDK, it allows developers to run and test applications on virtual devices with different configurations and Android versions.

#### 6. User Interface Design
- **XML Layouts**: UI components are typically defined in XML files.
- **Jetpack Compose**: A modern toolkit for building native UI using declarative programming.

#### 7. Frameworks and Libraries
- **Android Jetpack**: A set of libraries, tools, and guidance to help developers write high-quality apps more easily. Includes components like LiveData, ViewModel, Room, Navigation, and WorkManager.

#### 8. Testing
- **JUnit**: For unit testing.
- **Espresso**: For UI testing.
- **Robolectric**: For running tests on the JVM without an emulator.

#### iOS Development Environment

#### 1. Programming Languages
- **Objective-C**: An older language used for iOS development.
- **Swift**: The modern language for iOS development, designed to be safe, fast, and expressive.

#### 2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- **Xcode**: The official IDE for iOS development, which includes a code editor, debugger, and Interface Builder for designing user interfaces.

#### 3. Software Development Kit (SDK)
- **iOS SDK**: Provides the necessary tools and frameworks for developing iOS applications. Includes libraries like UIKit, Foundation, and Core Data.

#### 4. Build System
- **Xcode Build System**: Integrated into Xcode for compiling, packaging, and managing dependencies.

#### 5. Simulator
- **iOS Simulator**: Allows developers to test and debug applications on virtual devices with different iOS versions and device configurations.

#### 6. User Interface Design
- **Storyboard and XIB files**: Interface Builder within Xcode is used to design UIs visually.
- **SwiftUI**: A modern declarative framework for building UI across all Apple platforms.

#### 7. Frameworks and Libraries
- **Cocoa Touch**: The application development environment for iOS, including frameworks like UIKit, Foundation, and Core Graphics.
- **Combine**: A framework for handling asynchronous events by combining event-processing operators.

#### 8. Testing
- **XCTest**: For unit and UI testing.
- **Quick/Nimble**: Popular third-party frameworks for behavior-driven development (BDD).
